**Data Cleaning Process**

This document outlines the data cleaning steps taken to ensure data accuracy and consistency for the Sales Insights analysis in Tableau. 

1. **Sales Amount Correction**  
   - During data inspection, I found entries where the `Sales Amount` was either -1 or 0. This incorrect data, likely due to manual entry errors or system bugs, was removed.
   - **Action Taken**: 
     - Navigated to *Data -> Edit Data Source -> Add… -> Sales Amount* and applied a filter to exclude any values less than 1, ensuring only valid positive sales amounts are included.

2. **Market Code Validation**  
   - Upon review of the `Market` table, it was clear that the business operations are limited to India. However, certain entries had market codes (`Mark097` and `Mark999`) that corresponded to New York and Paris.
   - **Action Taken**: 
     - Applied a filter to exclude these incorrect market codes, ensuring that only data related to the Indian market was considered in the analysis.

3. **Currency Normalization**  
   - Some transactions were recorded in USD, while the primary currency for analysis is INR (Indian Rupee).
   - **Action Taken**:
     - Created a calculated field called *Normalized Amount* to standardize currency values in INR.
     - **Field Configuration**:  
       - **Role**: Continuous Measure  
       - **Type**: Calculated Field  
       - **Default Aggregation**: Sum  
       - **Formula**:  
         ``` 
         IF [Currency] = 'USD' THEN [Sales Amount] * 84  
         ELSE [Sales Amount]  
         END  
         ```
     - This formula converts all USD values to INR based on an exchange rate of 1 USD = 84 INR, ensuring currency consistency across the data.

These steps were implemented within Tableau’s data preparation interface to clean and standardize the data, making it ready for accurate and meaningful analysis.
